# Eigenstate thermolization of the 1-D photonic wire Hamiltonian

PhD rotation project, Ribeiro group, Emory University

In this project, the 1-D photonic wire Hamiltonian is studied as a model for light-matter interaction. We are especially interested in the behavior of the eigenspectrum as a function of the different chaos that the Hamiltonian is parameterized by - namely the energy, dipole, and position disorders. We would like to study the extent that this model Hamiltonian can be described by random matrix theory (RMT).
